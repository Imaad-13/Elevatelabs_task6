## 🧪 Passwords Tested

| Password         | Complexity Type              | Estimated Time to Crack | Tool Feedback                            |
|------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| abc123           | Simple (lowercase + numbers) | <1 second                | Too weak, easily guessable               |
| Abc123           | Medium (upper+lower+number)  | Few seconds              | Slightly better, but predictable         |
| Abc123!          | Strong (with symbol)         | Minutes                  | Good, but could be longer                |
| A$7kB!9pL@x      | Very Strong, 12+ chars       | Centuries                | Excellent – strong mix & length          |
| P@ssw0rd123456   | Common pattern, long         | Hours                    | Guessable, common pattern                |

## ✅ Best Practices for Strong Passwords

- Use a mix of **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **symbols**.
- Passwords should be **at least 12 characters** long.
- Avoid **common patterns** like `password123` or `qwerty`.
- Do not reuse passwords across platforms.
- Consider using a **password manager** for secure storage.

## 🛡️ Common Password Attack Methods

- **Brute Force Attack**: Tries all combinations.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses preloaded wordlists of common passwords.
- **Credential Stuffing**: Uses breached credentials on multiple services.
- **Phishing**: Tricks users into revealing passwords.

## 📌 Summary

Password complexity significantly improves defense against brute-force and dictionary attacks. Longer and more random passwords are exponentially harder to crack. Avoiding predictable patterns is key to ensuring account security.
